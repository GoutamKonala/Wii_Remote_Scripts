# Wii Remote Scripts

Basic Wii mote scripts that I either modified from someone else or built myself (Built most of them myself)

Some are built for GlovePIE (Which I learned first). Uses its own scripting language.

Eventually moved to FreePIE as it is open source. Uses python as its scripting language with FreePIE itself basically being an IDE with libraries for Python.


Most of the FreePIE scripts also use 2 external programs called VJoy and XOutput.

VJoy turns inputs into button and joystick outputs.

XOutput turns the outputs from VJoy into a XBox 360 controller for Windows to recognize.
